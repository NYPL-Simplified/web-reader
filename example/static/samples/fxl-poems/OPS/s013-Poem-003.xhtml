                  <p id="p46">Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was deep;</p>

                  <p id="p47">It was past twelve on a mid-winter night,</p>

                  <p id="p48">When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep:</p>

                  <p id="p49">There, with much work to do before the light,</p>

                  <p id="p50">We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might</p>

                  <p id="p51">Along the trench; sometimes a bullet sang,</p>

                  <p id="p52">And droning shells burst with a hollow bang;</p>

                  <p id="p53">We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one.</p>

                  <p id="id00093">Darkness: the distant wink of a huge gun.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza7">


                  <p id="p54">I turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm;</p>

                  <p id="p55">A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,</p>

                  <p id="p56">And lit the face of what had been a form</p>

                  <p id="p57">Floundering in mirk. He stood before me there;</p>

                  <p id="p58">I say that he was Christ; stiff in the glare,</p>

                  <p id="p59">And leaning forward from his burdening task,</p>

                  <p id="p60">Both arms supporting it; his eyes on mine</p>

                  <p id="p61">Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask</p>

                  <p id="id00094">Of mortal pain in Hell&#8217;s unholy shine.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza8">


                  <p id="p62">No thorny crown, only a woollen cap</p>

                  <p id="p63">He wore&#8212;an English soldier, white and strong,</p>

                  <p id="p64">Who loved his time like any simple chap,</p>

                  <p id="p65">Good days of work and sport and homely song;</p>

                  <p id="p66">Now he has learned that nights are very long,</p>

                  <p id="p67">And dawn a watching of the windowed sky.</p>

                  <p id="p68">But to the end, unjudging, he&#8217;ll endure</p>

                  <p id="p69">Horror and pain, not uncontent to die</p>

                  <p id="id00095">That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.</p>
