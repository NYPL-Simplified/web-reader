                  <p id="p1181">Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace</p>

                  <p id="p1101">Gently and slowly washing life away.</p>

                  <p id="p1104">Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore</p>

                  <p id="p1105">His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.</p>

                  <p id="p1106">But some one was beside him; soon he lay</p>

                  <p id="p1111">Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.</p>

                  <p id="p1112">He&#8217;s young; he hated war; how should he die</p>

                  <p id="p1113">When cruel old campaigners win safe through?</p>
