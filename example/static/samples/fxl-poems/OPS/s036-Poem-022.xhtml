                  <p id="p434">We&#8217;d gained our first objective hours before</p>

                  <p id="p435">While dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes,</p>

                  <p id="p436">Pallid, unshaved and thirsty, blind with smoke.</p>

                  <p id="p437">Things seemed all right at first. We held their line,</p>

                  <p id="p438">With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,</p>

                  <p id="p439">And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.</p>

                  <p id="p440">The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs</p>

                  <p id="p441">High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps</p>

                  <p id="p442">And trunks, face downward in the sucking mud,</p>

                  <p id="p443">Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;</p>

                  <p id="p444">And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,</p>

                  <p id="p445">Bulged, clotted heads, slept in the plastering slime.</p>

                  <p id="p446">And then the rain began,&#8212;the jolly old rain!</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza60">


                  <p id="p447">A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,</p>

                  <p id="p448">Staring across the morning blear with fog;</p>

                  <p id="p449">He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;</p>

                  <p id="p450">And then, of course, they started with five-nines</p>

                  <p id="p451">Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud.</p>

                  <p id="p452">Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst</p>

                  <p id="p453">Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,</p>

                  <p id="p454">While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza61">


                  <p id="p455">He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,</p>

                  <p id="p456">Sick for escape,&#8212;loathing the strangled horror</p>

                  <p id="p457">And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza62">


                  <p id="p458">An officer came blundering down the trench:</p>

                  <p id="p459">&#8220;Stand-to and man the fire-step!&#8221; On he went&#8230;.</p></div></div></div><p><span class="pagebreak-rw" id="pagebreak-rw_28" epub:type="pagebreak">28</span></p></section>
