                  <p id="p130">And there&#8217;s a wall of mist along the vale</p>

                  <p id="p131">Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves.</p>

                  <p id="p132">He gazes on it all, and scarce believes</p>

                  <p id="p133">That earth is telling its old peaceful tale;</p>

                  <p id="p134">He thanks the blessed world that he was born&#8230;.</p>

                  <p id="id00106">Then, far away, a lonely note of the horn.</p>

                  <p id="p135">They&#8217;re drawing the Big Wood! Unlatch the gate,</p>

                  <p id="p136">And set Golumpus going on the grass:</p>

                  <p id="p137"><i>He</i> knows the corner where it&#8217;s best to wait
                  </p>

                  <p id="p138">And hear the crashing woodland chorus pass;</p>

                  <p id="p139">The corner where old foxes make their track</p>

                  <p id="p140">To the Long Spinney; that&#8217;s the place to be.</p>

                  <p id="p141">The bracken shakes below an ivied tree,</p>

                  <p id="p142">And then a cub looks out; and &#8220;Tally-o-back!&#8221;</p>

                  <p id="p143">He bawls, and swings his thong with volleying crack,&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p144">All the clean thrill of autumn in his blood,</p>

                  <p id="p145">And hunting surging through him like a flood</p>

                  <p id="p146">In joyous welcome from the untroubled past;</p>

                  <p id="id00107">While the war drifts away, forgotten at last.</p>

                  <p id="p147">Now a red, sleepy sun above the rim</p>

                  <p id="p148">Of twilight stares along the quiet weald,</p>

                  <p id="p149">And the kind, simple country shines revealed</p>

                  <p id="p150">In solitudes of peace, no longer dim.</p>

                  <p id="p151">The old horse lifts his face and thanks the light,</p>

                  <p id="p152">Then stretches down his head to crop the green.</p>

                  <p id="p153">All things that he has loved are in his sight;</p>

                  <p id="p154">The places where his happiness has been</p>

                  <p id="id00108">Are in his eyes, his heart, and they are good.</p>
