                  <p id="p268">The road is thronged with women; soldiers pass</p>

                  <p id="p269">And halt, but never see them; yet they&#8217;re here&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p270">A patient crowd along the sodden grass,</p>

                  <p id="p271">Silent, worn out with waiting, sick with fear.</p>

                  <p id="p272">The road goes crawling up a long hillside,</p>

                  <p id="p273">All ruts and stones and sludge, and the emptied dregs</p>

                  <p id="p274">Of battle thrown in heaps. Here where they died</p>

                  <p id="p275">Are stretched big-bellied horses with stiff legs;</p>

                  <p id="p276">And dead men, bloody-fingered from the fight,</p>

                  <p id="p277">Stare up at caverned darkness winking white.</p>

                  <p id="p278">You in the bomb-scorched kilt, poor sprawling Jock,</p>

                  <p id="p279">You tottered here and fell, and stumbled on,</p>

                  <p id="p280">Half dazed for want of sleep. No dream could mock</p>

                  <p id="p281">Your reeling brain with comforts lost and gone.</p>

                  <p id="p282">You did not feel her arms about your knees,</p>

                  <p id="p283">Her blind caress, her lips upon your head:</p>

                  <p id="p284">Too tired for thoughts of home and love and ease,</p>

                  <p id="p285">The road would serve you well enough for bed.</p>
