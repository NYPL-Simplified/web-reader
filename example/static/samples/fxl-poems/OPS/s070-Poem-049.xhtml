                  <p id="p798">&#160;&#160;Because I&#8217;d like to know that you&#8217;re all right.</p>

                  <p id="p800">&#160;&#160;Or been sucked in by everlasting night?</p>

                  <p id="p807">Longed to get home and join the careless crowd</p>

                  <p id="p815">You were all out to try and save your skin,</p>

                  <p id="p816">&#160;&#160;Well knowing how much the world had got to give.</p>

                  <p id="p817">You joked at shells and talked the usual &#8220;shop,&#8221;</p>
