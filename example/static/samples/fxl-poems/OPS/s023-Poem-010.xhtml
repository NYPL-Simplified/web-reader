                  <p id="p238">And folded up the letter that she&#8217;d read.</p>

                  <p id="p239">&#8220;The Colonel writes so nicely.&#8221; Something broke</p>

                  <p id="p240">In the tired voice that quavered to a choke.</p>

                  <p id="p241">She half looked up. &#8220;We mothers are so proud</p>

                  <p id="p242">Of our dead soldiers.&#8221; Then her face was bowed.</p>

                  <p id="p244">He&#8217;d told the poor old dear some gallant lies</p>

                  <p id="p245">That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.</p>

                  <p id="p246">For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes</p>

                  <p id="p247">Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,</p>

                  <p id="p248">Because he&#8217;d been so brave, her glorious boy.</p>

                  <p id="p249">He thought how &#8220;Jack,&#8221; cold-footed, useless swine,</p>

                  <p id="p250">Had panicked down the trench that night the mine</p>

                  <p id="p251">Went up at Wicked Corner; how he&#8217;d tried</p>

                  <p id="p252">To get sent home; and how, at last, he died,</p>

                  <p id="p253">Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care</p>

                  <p id="p254">Except that lonely woman with white hair.</p>
