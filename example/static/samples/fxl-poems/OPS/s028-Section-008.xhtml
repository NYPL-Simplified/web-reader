                  <p id="p318">I&#8217;m looking at their blistered feet; young Jones</p>

                  <p id="p319">Stares up at me, mud-splashed and white and jaded;</p>

                  <p id="p320">Out of his eyes the morning light has faded.</p>

                  <p id="p321">Old soldiers with three winters in their bones</p>

                  <p id="p322">Puff their damp Woodbines, whistle, stretch their toes<br/>
&#160;
                  </p>

                  <p id="p323"><i>They</i> can still grin at me, for each of &#8217;em knows
                  </p>

                  <p id="p324">That I&#8217;m as tired as they are&#8230;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can they guess
                  </p>

                  <p id="p325">The secret burden that is always mine?&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p326">Pride in their courage; pity for their distress;</p>

                  <p id="p327">And burning bitterness</p>

                  <p id="p328">That I must take them to the accurs&#232;d Line.</p>

                  <p id="p329">I cannot hear their voices, but I see</p>

                  <p id="p330">Dim candles in the barn: they gulp their tea,</p>

                  <p id="p331">And soon they&#8217;ll sleep like logs. Ten miles away</p>

                  <p id="p332">The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife.</p>

                  <p id="p333">And I must lead them nearer, day by day,</p>

                  <p id="p334">To the foul beast of war that bludgeons life.</p>
