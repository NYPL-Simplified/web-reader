                  <p id="p1099">Three hours ago he stumbled up the trench;</p>

                  <p id="p180">Now he will never walk that road again:</p>

                  <p id="p181">He must be carried back, a jolting lump</p>

                  <p id="p182">Beyond all need of tenderness and care;</p>

                  <p id="id00115">A nine-stone corpse with nothing more to do.</p>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza23">


                  <p id="p183">He was a young man with a meagre wife</p>

                  <p id="p184">And two pale children in a Midland town;</p>

                  <p id="p185">He showed the photograph to all his mates;</p>

                  <p id="p186">And they considered him a decent chap</p>

                  <p id="p187">Who did his work and hadn&#8217;t much to say,</p>

                  <p id="p188">And always laughed at other people&#8217;s jokes</p>

                  <p id="id00116">Because he hadn&#8217;t any of his own.</p>

                  <p id="p189">That night, when he was busy at his job</p>

                  <p id="p190">Of piling bags along the parapet,</p>

                  <p id="p191">He thought how slow time went, stamping his feet,</p>

                  <p id="id00117">And blowing on his fingers, pinched with cold.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza25">


                  <p id="p192">He thought of getting back by half-past twelve,</p>

                  <p id="p193">And tot of rum to send him warm to sleep</p>

                  <p id="p194">In draughty dug-out frowsty with the fumes</p>

                  <p id="id00118">Of coke, and full of snoring, weary men.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza26">


                  <p id="p195">He pushed another bag along the top,</p>

                  <p id="p196">Craning his body outward; then a flare</p>

                  <p id="p197">Gave one white glimpse of No Man&#8217;s Land and wire;</p>

                  <p id="p198">And as he dropped his head the instant split</p>

                  <p id="id00119">His startled life with lead, and all went out.</p>
