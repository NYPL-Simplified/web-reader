                  <p id="p851">I am banished from the patient men who fight.</p>

                  <p id="p852">They smote my heart to pity, built my pride.</p>

                  <p id="p853">Shoulder to aching shoulder, side by side,</p>

                  <p id="p854">They trudged away from life&#8217;s broad wealds of light.</p>

                  <p id="p855">Their wrongs were mine; and ever in my sight</p>

                  <p id="p856">They went arrayed in honour. But they died,&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p857">Not one by one: and mutinous I cried</p>

                  <p id="p858">To those who sent them out into the night.</p>

                  <p id="p859">The darkness tells how vainly I have striven</p>

                  <p id="p860">To free them from the pit where they must dwell</p>

                  <p id="p861">In outcast gloom convulsed and jagged and riven</p>

                  <p id="p862">By grappling guns. Love drove me to rebel.</p>

                  <p id="p863">Love drives me back to grope with them through hell;</p>

                  <p id="p864">And in their tortured eyes I stand forgiven.</p>
