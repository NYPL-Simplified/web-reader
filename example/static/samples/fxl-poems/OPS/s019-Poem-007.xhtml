                  <p id="p156">Three hours ago he blundered up the trench,</p>

                  <p id="p157">Sliding and poising, groping with his boots;</p>

                  <p id="p158">Sometimes he tripped and lurched against the walls</p>

                  <p id="p159">With hands that pawed the sodden bags of chalk.</p>

                  <p id="p160">He couldn&#8217;t see the man who walked in front;</p>

                  <p id="p161">Only he heard the drum and rattle of feet</p>

                  <p id="p162">Stepping along the trench-boards,&#8212;often splashing</p>

                  <p id="p163">Wretchedly where the sludge was ankle-deep.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza20">


                  <p id="p164">Voices would grunt, &#8220;Keep to your right,&#8212;make way!&#8221;</p>

                  <p id="p165">When squeezing past the men from the front-line:</p>

                  <p id="p166">White faces peered, puffing a point of red;</p>

                  <p id="p167">Candles and braziers glinted through the chinks</p>

                  <p id="p168">And curtain-flaps of dug-outs; then the gloom</p>

                  <p id="p169">Swallowed his sense of sight; he stooped and swore</p>

                  <p id="p170">Because a sagging wire had caught his neck.</p>

                  <p id="p171">A flare went up; the shining whiteness spread</p>

                  <p id="p172">And flickered upward, showing nimble rats,</p>

                  <p id="p173">And mounds of glimmering sand-bags, bleached with rain;</p>

                  <p id="id00113">Then the slow, silver moment died in dark.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza21">


                  <p id="p174">The wind came posting by with chilly gusts</p>

                  <p id="p175">And buffeting at corners, piping thin</p>

                  <p id="p176">And dreary through the crannies; rifle-shots</p>

                  <p id="p177">Would split and crack and sing along the night,</p>

                  <p id="p178">And shells came calmly through the drizzling air</p>

                  <p id="id00114">To burst with hollow bang below the hill.</p></div></div></div><p><span class="pagebreak-rw" id="pagebreak-rw_11" epub:type="pagebreak">11</span></p></section>
