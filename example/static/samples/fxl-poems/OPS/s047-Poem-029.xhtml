                  <p id="p545">From the blind darkness I had heard his crying</p>

                  <p id="p546">And blundered in. With puzzled, patient face</p>

                  <p id="p547">A sergeant watched him; it was no good trying</p>

                  <p id="p548">To stop it; for he howled and beat his chest.</p>

                  <p id="p549">And, all because his brother had gone West,</p>

                  <p id="p550">Raved at the bleeding war; his rampant grief</p>

                  <p id="p551">Moaned, shouted, sobbed, and choked,<br/>
while he was kneeling
                  </p>

                  <p id="p552">Half-naked on the floor. In my belief</p>

                  <p id="p553">Such men have lost all patriotic feeling.</p>
