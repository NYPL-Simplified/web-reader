                  <p id="p1075">He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped</p>

                  <p id="p1076">Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;</p>

                  <p id="p1077">Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,</p>

                  <p id="p1078">Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p1079">Silence and safety; and his mortal shore</p>

                  <p id="p1080">Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.</p>

                  <p id="p1081">Some one was holding water to his mouth.</p>

                  <p id="p1082">He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped</p>

                  <p id="p1083">Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot</p>

                  <p id="p1084">The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.</p>

                  <p id="p1085">Water&#8212;calm, sliding green above the weir;</p>

                  <p id="p1086">Water&#8212;a sky-lit alley for his boat,</p>

                  <p id="p1087">Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers</p>

                  <p id="p1088">And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,</p>

                  <p id="p1089">He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.</p>

                  <p id="p1090">Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,</p>

                  <p id="p1091">Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.</p>

                  <p id="p1092">Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars</p>

                  <p id="p1093">Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;</p>

                  <p id="p1094">Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,</p>

                  <p id="p1095">Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.</p>

                  <p id="p1096">Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark;</p>

                  <p id="p1097">Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;</p>

                  <p id="p1098">Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers</p>
