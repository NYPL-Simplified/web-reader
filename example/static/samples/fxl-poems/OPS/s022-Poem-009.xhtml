                  <p id="p223">Then scrawled his name: &#8220;Your loving sweetheart, Willie.&#8221;</p>

                  <p id="p224">With crosses for a hug. He&#8217;d had a drink</p>

                  <p id="p225">Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,</p>

                  <p id="p226">For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.</p>

                  <p id="id00123">Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.</p>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza31">


                  <p id="p227">He couldn&#8217;t sleep that night. Stiff in the dark</p>

                  <p id="p228">He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,</p>

                  <p id="p229">When he&#8217;d go out as cheerful as a lark</p>

                  <p id="p230">In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm</p>

                  <p id="p231">With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear</p>

                  <p id="id00124">The simple, silly things she liked to hear.</p>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza32">


                  <p id="p232">And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge</p>

                  <p id="p233">Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten.</p>

                  <p id="p234">Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,</p>

                  <p id="p235">And everything but wretchedness forgotten.</p>

                  <p id="p236">To-night he&#8217;s in the pink; but soon he&#8217;ll die.</p>

                  <p id="id00125">And still the war goes on; <i>he</i> don&#8217;t know why.
