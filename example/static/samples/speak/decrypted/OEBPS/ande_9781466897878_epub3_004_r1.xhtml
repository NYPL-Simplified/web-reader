<p class="heading">Author&#x2019;s note:</p>
<p class="justify1">I wrote the original&#x00A0;<span class="italic">Speak</span>&#x00A0;in the late &#x2019;90s, before the Internet, before cell phones, and before the awesome phenomenon of graphic novels. I wrote it to deal with the depression and anxiety that had shadowed me since I was raped when I was thirteen years old. I never dreamed that the book would be published. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine that people would want to read it, or share it with friends, or teach it, or turn it into a movie.</p>
<p class="justify">But here we are, because life can be bewilderingly wonderful sometimes.</p>
<p class="justify">I&#x2019;ve watched the growth of graphic novels with excitement, and have long pondered how to transform the story of&#x00A0;<span class="italic">Speak</span>&#x00A0;into the graphic novel form. Art and artistic expression play a significant part in Melinda Sordino&#x2019;s transition from traumatized victim to empowered survivor. The story and the form seemed to be a natural fit, but only in the hands of the right artist.</p>
<p class="justify">Emily Carroll is that artist. Her artwork combined with my story have created a new expression of what it feels like to have your voice stolen from you, the battles that must be endured to find it again, and the triumph of speaking up.&#x00A0;</p>
