<p class="justify">Thank you so much, Emily, for sharing your talent and for all of your hard work on this book. Thanks also to our genius editor, Joy Peskin, and fabulous art director, Andrew Arnold, for helping us blend words and images to create magic. The entire Macmillan team has supported the novel, and now the graphic novel, with energy and passion that is very much appreciated.&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="justify">I reserve my deepest thanks for two groups:&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="justify">The community of educators who have boldly championed&#x00A0;<em>Speak</em>&#x00A0;through countless censorship challenges have helped change the national conversation about sexual violence. I salute their courage and am grateful for their friendship. My extended, blended family (including biological relatives and those of the heart) has cheered me on through years of writing, travel, some struggle, and much joy. They have taught me all that I know about the power of love to heal. My boundless love for them weaves the greatest story of all.</p>
