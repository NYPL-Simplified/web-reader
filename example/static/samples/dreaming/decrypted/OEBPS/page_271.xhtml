<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-1">California Dreamin’: </span><span class="pg271-1-1-text">The melody and the arrangement are beautiful, but it’s truly the second </span><span class="pg271-1-2-text">voice that makes all the difference. It’s thanks to this effect that the song was such a </span><span class="pg271-1-3-text">phenomenal success and that it ranks among the “500 greatest songs of all time” according to </span><span class="pg271-1-4-text">Rolling Stone</span><span class="pg271-1-5-text">.</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-2">Do You Wanna Dance?: </span><span class="pg271-2-1-text">Released right after the much better known version by the Beach </span><span class="pg271-2-2-text">Boys, I think it overwhelmingly surpasses that one. It’s probably the song in which the vocal </span><span class="pg271-2-3-text">alchemy between Cass and Denny is at its best: we really hear them answering each other, </span><span class="pg271-2-4-text">and the result is magnificent.</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-3">I Saw Her Again Last Night: </span><span class="pg271-3-1-text">The song where John had Denny sing, “I saw her again last </span><span class="pg271-3-2-text">night, and you know that I shouldn’t,” as if to atone for his mistake, during the period when </span><span class="pg271-3-3-text">Michelle had been completely excluded from the group in retaliation. (She subsequently </span><span class="pg271-3-4-text">returned.)</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-4">Dream a Little Dream of Me: </span><span class="pg271-4-1-text">This is the great classic of Cass’s solo songs. A standard from the </span><span class="pg271-4-2-text">1930s, she interprets it with a great deal of melancholy and gentleness. The song was released </span><span class="pg271-4-3-text">in 1968, at a point when the group was on the verge of exploding. So Dunhill Records decided </span><span class="pg271-4-4-text">to bet everything on Cass’s popularity and to credit the record to “Mama Cass with the Mamas </span><span class="pg271-4-5-text">&amp; the Papas” (to John Phillips’s not-so-great joy).</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-5">Dedicated to the One I Love: </span><span class="pg271-5-1-text">The first song in which it was decided that Michelle would </span><span class="pg271-5-2-text">sing the main melody (which lets her voice be heard for once), even if Cass’s chorus came in </span><span class="pg271-5-3-text">as reinforcement soon enough.</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-6">Dancing in the Streets: </span><span class="pg271-6-1-text">Yet another song that’s been covered about a thousand times, from </span><span class="pg271-6-2-text">Bowie to the Kinks, but the version by The Mamas &amp; The Papas, interpreted by Cass, really </span><span class="pg271-6-3-text">makes you want to dance in the street. At the end of the song, Cass and Denny talk to each </span><span class="pg271-6-4-text">other in the secret language they’d invented together.</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-7">Creeque Alley: </span><span class="pg271-7-1-text">The title refers to the street where The Mamas &amp; The Papas lived in the </span><span class="pg271-7-2-text">Virgin Islands. The song is the short story of the group’s journey: Cass dropping out of college, </span><span class="pg271-7-3-text">the trip to New York, The Mugwumps, their setbacks in the Islands, “California Dreamin’,” </span><span class="pg271-7-4-text">and even Cass falling in love at first sight with Denny. And then, of course, the delightful </span><span class="pg271-7-5-text">phrase that’s repeated at the end of each verse: “And no one’s getting fat, except Mama Cass.”</span></p>
<p class="CharOverride-5"><span class="pg271-8">Midnight Voyage: </span><span class="pg271-8-1-text">For me, this is the song that offers the best insight into Cass’s simultaneously </span><span class="pg271-8-2-text">strong but vulnerable voice, with all its nuances. She broke off at one point when she was </span><span class="pg271-8-3-text">reproached for starting in on the choruses too late, to which she replied that she was right, </span><span class="pg271-8-4-text">before asking mischievously, “You like that, Lou?” (to Lou Adler). And the song is worth </span><span class="pg271-8-5-text">listening to through to the end: It’s the whole last part, which she sings with the most emotion, </span><span class="pg271-8-6-text">that gives me a lump in my throat every time.</span></p>
